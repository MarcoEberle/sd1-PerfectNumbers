# Perfect Numbers

This class represents an algorithm to calculate perfect numbers.

In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. 

### Example: 

28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14

496 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248
